<p> I was born in Coronado Island, I was raised in Tijuana. I am a fluent Spanish speaker, as well in English. My birthday is in January the 28th.
I have a 2 year old daughter, her name is Valerie and 
I am a single mother. I live with my parents and my nephew. I have always been in the medical field, I was studying to be a Medical Assistant going on for RN. 
I have no background in codings, I am only familiar with the basics, this is a little step out of my comfort zone but I am addapting well as I go. I hope this will encourage me to go further on with this career path.
